## Explore the world even during this pandemic !! :smiley:
We know how the world is facing this pandemic due to **COVID-19**.
Everyone is at home and meeting, so many **issues like people are facing stress, depression, etc**.
Many people's summer vacation plans got shattered due to this pandemic. 
In this hard time, we came up with a solution to this problem. 
Our idea is to build a VR application which would **make people visit international places or tourist places** which they can't attend due to the COVID-19. 
Our app **will also provide them information about the places they want to visit**, and along with that, what makes us different is the interaction between the user and our application. 
The user **can ask questions related to the destination**, and he would receive an answer to the query. 
Our approach would be to make a VR application from Unity 3D and later merging the app with Alexa skills.
